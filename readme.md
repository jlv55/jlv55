👋 Hi there! I'm an experienced SEO consultant and ~~attempted~~ web developer with over a decade of experience in crafting and managing online projects. With a solid foundation in digital marketing and SEO, I've spent the last five years enhancing the digital presence of both startups and established companies.

I'm actively involved in open-source projects, collaborating with various teams and DAOs to drive content marketing strategies.

🔍 I specialize in integrating SEO best practices with the dynamic needs of the web3 space, focusing on maximizing visibility and engagement through strategies with a long-term view.
